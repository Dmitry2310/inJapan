# InJapan Project
### In this project, I used technologies such as : React js, css, Node js, Express, MongoDB, Material UI.
The idea of the project is for users to add interesting places in Japan when they visit it, you can find these articles by hashtags that users add when creating an article. The project is located on free servers, so the speed of its operation is severely limited.
